## Make it So

This is a sample Android app that demonstrates how to use Firebase Authentication, Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore and Hilt with Jetpack Compose UI. Make it So is a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add and edit to-do items, add flags, priorities, due dates, and mark the tasks as completed.

To explain how each product above was used in the code, we've written a series of articles that delve into creating this app from scratch. [Part 1](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/04/building-an-app-android-jetpack-compose-firebase) explains what you can do with this app, the motivation to choose each of the tools and an overview of the architecure.
