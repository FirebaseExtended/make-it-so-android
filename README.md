## Make it So

This is the source code for Make It So, a sample app that demonstrates how to use Firebase in an Android app. 

The first version of this app was built in 2022 and you can find it in the v1 folder - you will also find instructions to set up your Firebase project and links to articles, documentation and codelabs that guide you through the code. 

Version 2 of this app was built in 2025 and you can find it in the v2 folder - you will also find instructions to set up your Firebase project and connect it to the Make it So app. This version implements a new architecture, based on the latest recommendations outlined in the [Android Guide to App Architecture documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture). Similarly, the UI was developed in accordance with the best practices described in [Android's "Develop UI for Android" documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui).
