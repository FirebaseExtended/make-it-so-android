## Make it So

This is a sample Android app that demonstrates how to use Firebase Authentication, Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore, Performance Monitoring and Remote Config with Jetpack Compose UI. Make it So is a simple to-do list application that allows the user to add and edit to-do items, add flags, priorities, due dates, and mark the tasks as completed.

To explain how each product above was used in the code, we've written a series of articles that delve into creating this app from scratch. Navigate to [part 1](https://firebase.blog/posts/2022/04/building-an-app-android-jetpack-compose-firebase) of this series to understand how this app is structured. There you will find the links to all articles in the series.
